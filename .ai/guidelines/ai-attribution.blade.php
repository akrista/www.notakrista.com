Signed-off-by and Developer Certificate of Origin
=================================================

AI agents MUST NOT add Signed-off-by tags. Only humans can legally
certify the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO). The human submitter
is responsible for:

* Reviewing all AI-generated code
* Ensuring compliance with licensing requirements
* Adding their own Signed-off-by tag to certify the DCO
* Taking full responsibility for the contribution

Attribution
===========

When AI tools contribute to kernel development, proper attribution
helps track the evolving role of AI in the development process.
Contributions should include an Assisted-by tag in the following format::

Assisted-by: AGENT_NAME:MODEL_VERSION [TOOL1] [TOOL2]

Where:

* ``AGENT_NAME`` is the name of the AI tool or framework
* ``MODEL_VERSION`` is the specific model version used
* ``[TOOL1] [TOOL2]`` are optional specialized analysis tools used
(e.g., coccinelle, sparse, smatch, clang-tidy)

Basic development tools (git, gcc, make, editors) should not be listed.

Example::
Assisted-by: Claude:claude-3-opus coccinelle sparse
